<h1>About Me</h1>
   <h2>Melvin R.</h2>
<p>My name is Melvin and I am a sophomore at Galileo High School. I am academically interested in Computer Science. Game Develepoment like the games on Steam, or for PS4/XBOX. Personally I am focused on getting to try new things and meeting new people, and just having more fun in life. I value my family and the people that support me in my life. I won't get too deep into it but since elementary school I've been a failing student and I would never meet the passing requirements. It was not that bad throughout middle school but still was bad. I couldn't understand what it took to be successful, not until I finally succeeded in something that I truly felt accomplished for and so I finally realized that I can do better and a lot more. So since 9th grade I've been working hard and trying new things. I hope that I can learn more about programming so that I can advance in my career as a video game developer.</p>
